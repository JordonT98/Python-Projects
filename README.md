# Projects

[Movie Portfolio Project](https://github.com/JordonT98/Python-Projects/blob/main/Movie%20Portfolio%20Project.ipynb)

•	Utilized Python for data extraction, cleaning, type conversion, and sorting.

•	Created scatter plots, seaborn plots, and correlation matrices using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

•	Employed pandas and NumPy for data aggregation and visualization. 


[Automatic File Sorter](https://github.com/JordonT98/Python-Projects/blob/main/Automatic%20File%20Sorter.ipynb)

•	 Utilized the `os` and `shutil` modules for file manipulation tasks.

•	 Created directories based on file types ('csv files', 'image files', 'text files') using `os.makedirs()`.

•	 Moved files to their respective directories based on file extensions using `shutil.move()`.


[BMI Calculator](https://github.com/JordonT98/Python-Projects/blob/main/BMI%20Calculator.ipynb)

• Created a BMI calculator using Python, which calculates the Body Mass Index based on user input for weight and height.

• Utilized conditional statements to determine the user's weight status (underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.) based on their calculated BMI.

• Implemented user-friendly prompts and messages for input and output, providing a personalized experience for the user.


[Scraping Data](https://github.com/JordonT98/Python-Projects/blob/main/Scraping%20Data.ipynb)

• Utilized BeautifulSoup and requests libraries in Python to scrape data from a Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue.

• Parsed the HTML content of the webpage using BeautifulSoup and extracted relevant table titles and data.

• Created a Pandas DataFrame to organize the scraped data into a structured format and exported it to a CSV file for further analysis.
